# Vehicle Rental Management System - SQL Queries

A collection of SQL queries demonstrating key database concepts for a vehicle rental management system.

## Project Overview

This project contains SQL queries for managing a vehicle rental database with three main tables:
- **Users** - Customer and admin information
- **Vehicles** - Fleet inventory and availability
- **Bookings** - Rental transactions

## Query Descriptions

### Query 1: Booking Information with Customer and Vehicle Details
- **Concept:** INNER JOIN

- Retrieves complete booking records by joining bookings with user and vehicle information. Useful for generating booking reports with readable customer and vehicle names.

### Query 2: Vehicles That Have Never Been Booked
- **Concept:** NOT EXISTS

- Identifies vehicles in the fleet that have no booking history. Helps management track underutilized inventory.

### Query 3: Available Vehicles by Type
- **Concept:** WHERE Clause

- Filters vehicles based on availability status and type (e.g., cars, bikes, trucks). Enables customers to search for available vehicles of their preferred category.

### Query 4: Vehicles with Multiple Bookings
- **Concept:** GROUP BY and HAVING

- Analyzes booking frequency to find vehicles with more than 2 bookings. Identifies popular vehicles for business insights and fleet management.

## Database Schema

- **Users Table**: user_id (Primary Key), name, email, phone, role

- **Vehicles Table**: vehicle_id (Primary Key), name, type, model, registration_number, rental_price, status

- **Bookings Table**: booking_id (Primary Key), user_id (FK), vehicle_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status, total_cost
